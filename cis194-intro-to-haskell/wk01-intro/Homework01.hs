{- Styleguide:
     - DO use camelCase for function and variable names.
     - DO use descriptive function names.
     - DON'T use tabs.
     - DO try to keep every line under 80 characters.
     - DO give every top-level function a type signature. (It doesn't
     hurt to give them to locally defined functions and constants as
     well.)
     - DO precede every top-level function by an explanatory comment.
     - DO use -Wall (no warnings).
     - DO use small functions and compose them to add complexity.
     - DO make all your functions total (sensible results for every
     input). -}
